00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.970
Here is our visualization tool for the MBTA.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.340
On the top left of the screen, you will be
able to see a map of all MBTA train stations

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.080
for the red, orange, green and blue lines.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.070
Each dot represents a single station, and
its color represents which line it belongs

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.570
to.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.650
On the top right, we have a pie chart representing
the rider distribution by the time of day.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.160
On the bottom right, we have a bar chart representing
the total ridership for each line.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.730
On the bottom left, we have a table showing
all the stations that the user has currently

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.270
selected and its corresponding data.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.280
The table, bar chart and pie chart are all
are linked to the map on the top left.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.440
Since we have currently selected Harvard here,
the pie chart shows the rider distribution

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.601
for Harvard, the bar chart highlights red
because Harvard is a on the red line, and

00:00:57.601 --> 00:01:01.000
the table shows the data for Harvard station.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.040
Additionally, users can select more than one
station.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.100
For example, the MBTA maintenance team wants
to find the best time of day to do maintenance

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.509
on the Harvard, Porter and Sullivan Square
stations.

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:23.299
As Harvard is already selected, we select
Sullivan Square and Porter on our map.

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.850
Now we see below that all these stations show
up on our table.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.200
The bar chart now highlights orange too, as
Sullivan square belongs to the orange line.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.909
The pie chart also updates showing data for
all three stations.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.150
From our pie chart, we can tell that the best
time of the day to do maintenance is sometime

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.189
during the morning or the late evening.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:53.670
If we want, we can always unselect stations
from our map like this, and the charts will

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.600
automatically update.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.529
And that is how to use our visualization tool.

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:59.460
Thank you for watching.
